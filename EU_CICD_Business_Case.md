# EU-Based CICD Startup - Business Case

## Market Opportunity

- **Global CICD market:** $1.73B (2025) → $4.53B (2030) at 21% CAGR
- **Current dominance:** GitHub Actions with 4M daily workflows, 11.5B annual minutes consumed
- **Market gap:** No EU-incorporated, EU-headquartered CICD platform exists at scale

## Trigger Event

- Heavy EU taxation on US big tech (GitHub/Microsoft, GitLab) increases costs and breaks convenience advantage
- EU regulatory push for data sovereignty and compliance (GDPR, NIS2) makes self-hosted/EU hosting mandatory for enterprises
- Self-hosted solutions (Jenkins) fragmented and aging; no modern alternative available

## Opportunity

**Positioning:** EU data residency, EU compliance-native, open-core DevOps platform (Git + CI/CD + security)

**Market Size:**
- TAM: Enterprise segment + government/critical infrastructure (EU-only)
- Estimated addressable market: 15-25% of current GitHub Actions revenue in EU
- EU market alone: $300-400M annually (extrapolated from growth trajectory)

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Data Sovereignty by Default** - EU infrastructure, EU entity status eliminates regulatory friction
2. **Compliance-Built-In** - GDPR, NIS2, and sector-specific regulation support native to platform
3. **Hybrid Model** - Self-hosted + SaaS options avoid taxation issues and enterprise concerns
4. **Open-Source Foundation** - Builds trust, community, and credibility in developer market
5. **Timing** - Enters market at inflection point where cost/compliance concerns override network effects

## Key Risks

- **Network Effects:** Established developer habits favor GitHub/GitLab despite cost increases
- **Capital Requirements:** Significant funding needed to compete on features and reliability
- **Limited TAM:** Niche positioning to EU-only unless taxation becomes severe
- **Feature Parity:** Must match or exceed GitHub Actions feature set quickly
- **Migration Costs:** Enterprise switching costs remain high even with tax burden

## Market Dynamics Post-Taxation

**Expected outcomes if heavy EU taxation implemented:**
- Both GitHub Actions and GitLab lose market share to self-hosted solutions
- Fragmentation rather than consolidation around any single platform
- Jenkins and similar open-source tools see resurgence as "politically safe" choice
- EU companies prioritize data sovereignty over feature richness

## Go-To-Market Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Build open-source credibility, capture self-hosted market segment
2. **Phase 2 (Growth):** Develop commercial SaaS offering targeting compliance-conscious enterprises
3. **Phase 3 (Scale):** Build out enterprise features (SSO, advanced security, audit trails)
4. **Distribution:** Direct sales to EU enterprises, partnerships with hosting/cloud providers

## Business Model

- **Open-Core:** Free, self-hosted version (similar to GitLab)
- **SaaS Tier:** €50-500/month depending on usage (EU-hosted by default)
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing for large organizations with dedicated support
- **Revenue Focus:** EU enterprises with compliance requirements (willingness to pay premium for certainty)

## Exit Potential

- Acquisition by EU tech company (SAP, Atlassian, etc.) or private equity
- IPO if market conditions support DevOps/infrastructure startups
- Sustained independent business if pricing power holds post-taxation

## Conclusion

A well-positioned EU CICD startup can capture significant market share if:
1. EU taxation on US big tech materializes
2. Compliance requirements tighten (likely regardless)
3. Product achieves feature parity with GitHub Actions
4. Strong execution on open-source foundation and community building

**Best positioned segment:** Enterprise customers with non-negotiable EU data residency and compliance requirements. Estimated 20-30% of EU enterprise market willing to pay 15-25% premium for these guarantees.
